The package is easily added to and configured in any new or existing Touch application, immediately giving it access to Azure cloud services.</p>\n\n<p>Azure also takes the headache out of adding authentication to your application by incorporating user authentication through Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft or Google accounts.</p>\n\n<p>And for communication, Push Notification gives your application the added feature of sending messages to your users.</p>\n\n<h2 id='getting_started-section-about-the-guides'>About the Guides</h2>\n\n<p>These guides are directed towards intermediate to advanced web application developers who have a good understanding of HTML, JavaScript, and who are familiar with our Sencha Touch framework.</p>\n\n<p>They are designed to walk you through the process of creating a simple Touch application with Azure which utilizes all of the available Azure Mobile services.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You will need a WebKit-based browser to run the example applications. Desktop WebKit browsers include Google Chrome and Apple Safari. Supported mobile devices include Windows Phone, Android and iOS. </strong></p>\n\n<h2 id='getting_started-section-before-you-start'>Before You Start</h2>\n\n<p>As your Sencha Touch application will be communicating with an Azure mobile service, it is strongly suggested that you setup an Azure mobile service <strong>before</strong> moving on to including Azure into your application.</p>\n\n<p>Creating an Azure mobile service requires you to</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Sign Up for Microsoft Azure</strong></p>\n\n<p> In order to access Windows Azure, you must first signup for Azure services by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.windowsazure.com\">Windows Azure website</a>. Once you have obtained access to Azure, you will be able to review documentation and setup mobile services for any application you wish to create using Sencha Touch.\n &nbsp;\n <P></P></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Create An Azure Service</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Select the <strong>Mobile Services</strong> section of the <strong>Azure Portal</strong></li>\n<li> Create a new <strong>Mobile Service</strong> noting the URL you define for the service.</li>\n<li> Generate Access Keys for your Service via <strong>Manage Keys</strong> button (the keys will be used in your Touch application to allow communication with the Azure service).</li>\n<li> Create any data tables your Touch application may require for application data storage.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h2 id='getting_started-section-software-requirements'>Software Requirements</h2>\n\n<p>The Touch Extensions for Windows Azure requires the following items to be installed for proper application development as laid out in the guides and examples provided in this documentation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://wwww.sencha.com/products/touch/download\">Sencha Touch</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download\">Sencha Cmd Tool</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Once you have created an Azure service and installed the required software, you may proceed with <a href=\"#!/guide/including_azure\">downloading and including</a> the Azure package into your application.</p>\n","title":"Getting Started"});
